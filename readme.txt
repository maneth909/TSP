-> Clone or download both geneticAlgorithm.py and greedyAlgorithm.py (run them separately)
-> Input data in a form of dictionary (as many as you prefer)
    - geneticAlgorithm.py: maximum number of points is 30-50 (due to large memory consumption)
    - greedyAlgorithm.py: can take up to 1000 number of points
-> Choose the starting point


# ---------- Example of input----------
city_points = {
    "A": (0, 0),
    "B": (1, 5),
    "C": (5, 2),
    "D": (6, 6),
    "E": (8, 3)
}
start_city = "A" # starting point
